## Final Perspectives on Research

### Experience Overview:
At the start of this experience, I listed several objectives I hope to accomplish. They were: 

1. To be able to articulate the scientific process within this domain 
	

2. To expand my technical skill set and gain experience working with domain-specific tools.
	

3. To gain an understanding of what a doctorate program in Computer Science might be like and finalize my future education plans.
	 

4. To learn about Scientometrics!
